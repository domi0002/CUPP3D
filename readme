Compilation Instructions
------------------------

Edit initbash.sh and set paths: 
source initbash.sh

Edit compile.sh and change the Device Architecture type

e.g. for Quadro GP 100, use -arch=sm_60

Execute ./compile.sh


Running Instructions
-----------------------

eu3d is a 3d euler solver, nth order in space
current test case corresponds to  vortex convection

Execute eu3d with the following arguments:

./eu3d  <Npts-x>  <Npts-y>  <Npts-z>  deltaT  numberOfSteps

Caveat:
eu3d adds 3 additional fringe points on either side of the mesh min/max, that
makes it 6 additional points in each direction. Thus 

Npts_x = Npts_x + 6
Npts_y = Npts_y + 6
Nptz_z = Npts_z + 6

You should make sure that this 'final'
    Npts_x should divide 64  ( which is threadPerBlock_x)
    Nptx_y should divide 2   ( ......................._y)
    Nptz_z should divide 2   ( ......................._z)

Threads per block is hardcoded in eu3d.cu line 19:
    distArray::setCudaProperties(Nx,Ny,Nz,64,2,2);
 

Visualization
-------------

The solver outputs bare xy density data at t=0 and the final step into the files
    density0.dat
    densityFinal.dat

The included MATLAB plt.m file with the following syntax will contour the density
    plt

Npts-x/y are original number points(what you had provided when the solver was run).


Example Run
------------

<user>:run$ ./eu3d 250 76 76 0.001 100
